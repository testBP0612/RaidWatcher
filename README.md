This tool provides an overview of World of Warcraft raiders with their item level and latest mythic+ activity.

I wrote the tool in June 2019 in Python, then I used ChatGPT to get the Web version, and Copilot to add item level and style sheet.

# How to use this tool?

Fork this repository; update players.txt. That's it!
